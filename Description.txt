This is a blog website project built using ExpressJS and NodeJS. 

I designed this website to allow users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts. 

This project is just a MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture to separate concerns and improve code organization.

I have made the backend of the project using NodeJS and ExpressJS, which provide a robust and efficient way to handle server-side logic and routing. 
The frontend of the project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a responsive and user-friendly interface.

Some of the key features of this project include:

User authentication and authorization using PassportJS(yet to integrate this feature)
Database integration with MongoDB using MongooseJS
Pagination and search functionality for blog posts(yet to integrate this feature)
Commenting system for blog posts
Admin panel for managing blog posts and users


Please take time to understand as I took lots of efforts to write a clean code which is well-documented and easy to follow, making it a great learning resource for developers of all skill levels.

To run this project locally, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies using npm. Then, start the server using the command "npm start". You can access the website at http://localhost:3000.
